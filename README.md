Data analysis stuff that I seem to use quite a bit for some reason. 

correlationChecker.py uses Pearson correlation coefficient. Relevant for time series that are both linear it seems.

grubbsTest is some non-linear correlation checker. I have no idea if it is relevant or what it is

spearmanRankCorrelation.py uses Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Measures the relative 'up and down' of both time series to see if they are increasing and decreasing at the same time. Helpful when both time series are non-linear
